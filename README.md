## Disclaimer
- These rules are generalized. If they do not cover certain edge cases, then feel free to address it however you would like to at your own discretion!
## MAIN RULE
- NO TANKS / NO HEALERS (If forced to use in trial, and no way to bypass, it's fine)
- NO Preservation or Abundance path for SU (you can select the blessings, but not the path)

## Other Rules
- for rule #5 milestones, check below

## Rule: 5) Before You Pull (Banner Unlock Milestones)

- once you go **"Post TL 60"**, all **"Pre TL 60"** milestones will still need to be completed, but they do NOT grant a banner unlock.
- **upon completion of a milestone:** one character OR weapon banner unlock of your choice (You CAN hoard banner unlocks as you beat each milestone)
- If you run out of pulls and die -> Nothing happens. You're just at 0 jades and broke kekw.
